# MorseChatV2

## Overview

The goal of the application is to provide a platform for the deaf-blind or other disabled individuals that rely on morse code for communication, to communicate with other people. The app can translate a morse code input via taps into text and convert text input into morse as haptic feedback from the device. The deaf-blind, with the help of a more capable individual, will be able to communicate with another individual that may not know morse code through the app.

## Features 
### Text-to-Haptic feedback
The application will allow users to enter keyboard input which will be converted into morse code. The morse code will be emitted as haptic feedback and vibration from the device.

### Tap-to-Text
The application will receive morse code input from the user via short or long taps which will be converted into text.
